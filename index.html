	Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to the
	people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows. Some

	kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too. Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you,
